# AVAP AI aka Brunix for Visual Studio Code

The **AVAP AI aka Brunix** extension for Visual Studio Code offers a powerful set of tools to enhance your coding experience by integrating AI-driven code suggestions and managing conversations and contexts dynamically.

To get started, ensure you have installed both **AVAP AI aka Brunix** and the **AVAP Dev Extensions for Visual Studio Code**. Note that each user must provide their OpenAI API key to enable the extension's functionality.

## Support for Developers

The **AVAP AI aka Brunix** extension for Visual Studio Code is compatible with vscode.dev. You can also find additional resources and information at www.brunixassistant.dev.

## Installed Extensions

**AVAP AI aka Brunix** requires the base extension **AVAP Dev Extensions for Visual Studio Code** to function properly.

## Quick start

- Step 1. Install the **AVAP Dev Extensions for Visual Studio Code** and then **AVAP AI aka Brunix** extension.
- Step 2. Go to the settings page and add your OpenAI API key.
- Step 3. Start by commenting in your code to receive AI-driven code suggestions in real time or ask Brunix in the **Conversations** windows.

### Managing Conversations and Contexts

**AVAP AI aka Brunix** offers powerful conversation and context management capabilities:

- **Conversations**: You can load, rename, and delete previous conversations. Use the following icons to manage them:
  - <img src="https://developer.101obex.com/static_images/extensions/setting-icon.png" width="20"> to load a conversation.
  - <img src="https://developer.101obex.com/static_images/extensions/pencil-icon.png" width="20"> to rename.
  - <img src="https://developer.101obex.com/static_images/extensions/terminal-kill-icon.png" width="20"> to delete.
  
- **Contexts**: Similar to conversations, you can load, rename, and delete contexts. Additionally, you can add new context files to your repository using the **+** button.

In the conversation window, youâ€™ll find two useful buttons:
- <img src="https://developer.101obex.com/static_images/extensions/terminal-kill-icon.png" width="20">: Clears the current conversation and unloads the active context.
- <img src="https://developer.101obex.com/static_images/extensions/setings-icon.png" width="20">: Opens the settings page, filtering the options specifically for **Brunix**.
- <img src="https://developer.101obex.com/static_images/extensions/save-icon.png" width="20">: Stores actual conversation in **Conversation** window.

### Code Proposals

When you comment in your code, **Brunix** generates a code proposal based on your input. You can configure the processing time for these proposals in the extension settings, which starts as soon as you press **Enter** after your comment.

For each proposal, three options are available:

- **Accept Proposal**: Consolidates the suggested code into your editor.
- **New Proposal**: Queries for another code suggestion.
- **Reject Proposal**: Cancels the process and no further suggestions are provided for that comment.
